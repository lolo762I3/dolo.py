It provides a simple classification scheme to describe many types of models, allows to write the models as simple text files and compiles these files into efficient Python objects representing them. It also provides many reference solution algorithms to find the solution of these models under rational expectations. Dolo understand several types of nonlinear models with occasionnally binding constraints (with or without exogenous discrete shocks), as well as local pertubations models, like Dynare. It is a very adequate tool to study zero-lower bound issues, or sudden-stop problems, for instance. Sophisticated solution routines are available: local perturbations up to third order, perfect foresight solution, policy iteration, value iteration. Most of these solutions are either parallelized or vectorized. They are written in pure Python, and can easily be inspected or adapted. Thanks to the simple and consistent Python API for models, it is possible to write models in pure Python, or to implement other solution algorithms on top it. Frequently Asked Questions No question was ever asked. Certainly because it's all very clear.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#dolo","text":"","title":"Dolo"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Dolo is a tool to describe and solve economic models.
